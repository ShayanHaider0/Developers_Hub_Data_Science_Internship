# Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts which bank customers are likely to leave (churn) using a classification model. It includes data cleaning, encoding categorical features, and exploratory analysis of customer attributes. A Logistic Regression or Random Forest model is trained and evaluated using accuracy and a classification report. Feature importance analysis helps identify key factors influencing customer churn.
