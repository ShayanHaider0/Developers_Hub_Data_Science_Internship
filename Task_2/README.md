# Credit Risk Prediction

This project predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default using a classification model. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization of key features. A Logistic Regression is trained and evaluated using accuracy and a confusion matrix. The results help identify potential defaulters and assess overall credit risk.
